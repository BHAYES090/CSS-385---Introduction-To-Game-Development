This posture-break system can appear throughout the game in multiple ways. Regular enemies can teach timing by 
using low posture thresholds, letting new players practice breaking guards safely. Mini-bosses can expand the 
mechanic by requiring multiple staggers or introducing varied recovery speeds. Boss fights can use it as a phase 
transition, forcing players to manage posture and positioning under pressure. Environmental puzzles could also use 
posture as a concept, such as breaking doors, statues, or barriers that act like enemies with posture meters. 
This keeps the mechanic consistent across exploration and combat. Using one clear interaction in different situations
reinforces learning and gives the world a sense of unity. Each encounter feels different but remains built around 
the same rule: persistence and precision lead to a decisive opening.
