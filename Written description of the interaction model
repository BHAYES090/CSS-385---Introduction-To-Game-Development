The interaction model focuses on breaking an enemy’s posture to open a brief execution window. The player raises 
the enemy’s posture by landing attacks, perfect parries, or heavy strikes. When posture reaches its limit, the enemy 
becomes staggered for a short time. During this window, the player can move close and press a key to perform a finishing 
execution. The objective of this interaction is to make combat feel tense but rewarding. Success depends on timing, rhythm, 
and awareness rather than simple button mashing. The player reads visual and audio feedback to know when the enemy is 
vulnerable. This system pushes the player to stay engaged and deliberate while rewarding mastery of the game’s 
combat rhythm. It fits naturally within action combat games inspired by Souls and Sekiro, where one well-timed interaction 
can change the outcome of a battle.
