For games similar to mine, which draw inspiration from Soulslike design, media items such as environmental soundscapes, atmospheric music tracks, short lore-driven cinematics, 
in-engine cutscenes, and character voice lines are commonly used to reinforce tone, guide player emotion, and deliver worldbuilding without interrupting gameplay. Many of these 
games also integrate item description text, environmental art, boss introduction stingers, and subtle ambient cues to create immersion and communicate challenge or danger. 

To integrate these kinds of media into a game, one effective strategy is event-driven media activation, where audio or video triggers based on player location, 
combat state, or story progression. This approach keeps the experience dynamic and responsive, but it can be more complex to implement because it requires careful
timing, scripting, and performance considerations. Another strategy is embedding media directly into level design, such as baked-in ambient sound loops, static 
UI-driven item descriptions, or pre-placed cutscene triggers. This method is more stable and predictable but risks feeling less organic if overused or placed too 
rigidly. For my own project, I would use a hybrid event-driven approach with selective embedded assets so that the game feels reactive, atmospheric, and tightly connected 
to player actions. 

This aligns with the style of games that rely heavily on environmental storytelling and emotional tone. It also gives me the flexibility to scale content over time, 
maintain performance, and ensure that every piece of media serves a deliberate gameplay function rather than becoming noise.
