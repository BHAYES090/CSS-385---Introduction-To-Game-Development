I have been inspired by souls-like games since I first started playing them in ~2013. To this day, the only reason I even own a PS, is to play Bloodborne the Demon Souls remake.  I find inspiration from the concepts found in the Souls-Sekiro-Borne-Ring series and souls-like games in general. To me these are defined by: difficulty, historical dark fantasy, ambiguous story line, Jungian-psychological stuff, Lovecraftian cosmic horror, Kurt-Vonnegut-surrealism, breaking the 4th wall, art, etc.
