I am going to *try* to implement, historical elements - maybe WW2, or cold war, or maybe specific historical events like 'Escape Stalingrad' or 'Escape Troy or constantinople at the very bitter awful end (you dont make it)' or maybe  'You're a POW and you found your opportunity to escape during the bombardment - RUN!'  but will have like dungeon elements to it - think 'Bloodborne" meets 'The Venture of Vermis'  meets 'Iron Lung' meets 'Slaughter House 5'. I will probably have to make a 2D like side scrolling platformer like mario or cuphead, or maybe a top down perspective like game like pokemon or the early Dragon Ball Z games. The final boss will defiantly be something wild - maybe the creature described from William Butler Yeats' Poem - 'The Second Coming' :

A shape with lion body and the head of a man,
A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,
Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it
Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds.
The darkness drops again; but now I know
That twenty centuries of stony sleep
Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle
