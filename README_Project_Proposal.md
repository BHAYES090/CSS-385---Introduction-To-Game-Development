ELEVATOR PITCH (≤100 words)
This 2D action sidescroller places the player in the role of a WWII POW escaping through a hostile jungle. Players run, jump, and shoot through enemy patrols while navigating environmental hazards. The fast-paced combat, simple controls, and reactive AI create a tense but engaging experience that rewards timing and awareness.

GAME SYNOPSIS, OBJECTIVE, AND MECHANICS
Synopsis:
You play as a captured soldier attempting to flee a remote jungle camp. Armed with a pistol and limited resources, you must push through increasingly dangerous terrain.

Objective:
Reach the end of each level by surviving enemy encounters, avoiding obstacles, and defeating opponents who detect and engage you.

Core Mechanics:
- Player can run, jump, and shoot.
- Parallax-scrolling jungle environment enhances depth.
- Collision tiles allow platform navigation.
- Enemy AI detects player presence, moves toward firing range, and shoots back.
- Basic health system to track player/enemy damage.
- Win by reaching the level’s exit; lose by depletion of player health.
